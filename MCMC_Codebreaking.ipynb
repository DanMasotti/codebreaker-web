    "# Using Metropolis-Hastings MCMC to decode hidden text\n",
    "Given scrambled passages from Tolstoy's *War and Peace*, I used the algorithm outlined in [Diaconis' paper](https://math.uchicago.edu/~shmuel/Network-course-readings/MCMCRev.pdf) to break the substitution cipher.  The first step was to create a model for true English language.  I didn't want to use *War and Peace* as corpus because in practice, I wouldn't know from where the ciphertext came.  I used a free sample of the [Wikipedia Corpus](https://www.english-corpora.org/wiki/), which has about 1.7 million words.  I had to do some preprocessing, so I wrote a simple python script *clean_text.py*.\n",

so doing for my mind was made up to sail in no other than a nantucket craft because there was a fine boisterous something about exerything connected with that famous old island which amazingly pleased me besides though new bedford has of late been gradualy monopolising the business of whaling and though in this matter poor old nantucket is now much behind her yet nantucket was her great original the tyre of this carthage the place where the first dead american whale was stranded where else but from nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen the red men first saly out in canoes to gixe chase to the lexiathan and where but from nantucket too did that first adxenturous little sloop put forth partly laden with imported cobblestones so goes the story to throw at the whales in order to discoxer when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit  now haxing a night a day and stil another night folowing before me in new bedford ere i could embark for my destined port it became a matter of concernment where i was to eat and sleep meanwhile it was a xery dubious looking nay a xery dark and dismal night bitingly cold and cheerless i knew no one in the place with anvious grapnels i had sounded my pocket and only brought up a few pieces of silxer so wherexer you go ishmael said i to myself as i stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south wherexer in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night my dear ishmael be sure to inquire the price and dont be too particular  with halting steps i paced the streets and passed the sign of the crossed harpoons but it looked too evpensixe and joly there further on from the bright red windows of the sword fish inn there came such ferxent rays that it seemed to haxe melted the packed snow and ice from before the house for exerywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard asphaltic paxement rather weary for me when i struck my foot against the flinty projections because from hard remorseless serxice the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight too evpensixe and joly again thought i pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within but go on ishmael said i at last dont you hear get away from before the door your patched boots are stopping the way so on i went i now by instinct folowed the streets that took me waterward for there doubtless were the cheapest if not the cheeriest inns  such dreary streets blocks of blackness not houses on either hand and here and there a candle like a candle moxing about in a tomb at this hour of the night of the last day of the week that quarter of the town proxed al but deserted but presently i came to a smoky light proceeding from a low wide building the door of which stood inxitingly open it had a careless look as if it were meant for the uses of the public so entering the first thing i did was to stumble oxer an ash bov in the porch ha thought i ha as the flying particles almost choked me are these ashes from that destroyed city gomorrah but the crossed harpoons and the sword fish this then must needs be the sign of the trap howexer i picked myself up and hearing a loud xoice within pushed on and opened a second interior door  it seemed the great black parliament sitting in tophet a hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer and beyond a black angel of doom was beating a book in a pulpit it was a negro church and the preachers tevt was about the blackness of darkness and the weeping and wailing and teeth gnashing there ha ishmael muttered i backing out wretched entertainment at the sign of the trap  moxing on i at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks and heard a forlorn creaking in the air and looking up saw a swinging sign oxer the door with a white painting upon it faintly representing a tal straight jet of misty spray and these words underneath the spouter inn peter coffin  coffin spouter rather ominous in that particular connevion thought i but it is a common name in nantucket they say and i suppose this peter here is an emigrant from there as the light looked so dim and the place for the time looked quiet enough and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might haxe been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district and as the swinging sign had a poxerty stricken sort of creak to it i thought that here was the xery spot for cheap lodgings and the best of pea coffee  it was a queer sort of place a gable ended old house one side palsied as it were and leaning oxer sadly it stood on a sharp bleak corner where that tempestuous wind euroclydon kept up a worse howling than exer it did about poor pauls tossed craft euroclydon nexertheless is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in doors with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed in judging of that tempestuous wind caled euroclydon says an old writer of whose works i possess the only copy evtant it maketh a marxelous difference whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is al on the outside or whether thou obserxest it from that sashless window where the frost is on both sides and of which the wight death is the only glazier true enough thought i as this passage occurred to my mind old black letter thou reasonest wel yes these eyes are windows and this body of mine is the house what a pity they didnt stop up the chinks and the crannies though and thrust in a little lint here and there but its too late to make any improxements now the unixerse is finished the copestone is on and the chips were carted off a milion years ago poor lazarus there chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pilow and shaking off his tatters with his shixerings he might plug up both ears with rags and put a corn cob into his mouth and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous euroclydon euroclydon says old dixes in his red silken wrapper he had a redder one afterwards pooh pooh what a fine frosty night how orion glitters what northern lights let them talk of their oriental summer climes of exerlasting conserxatories gixe me the prixilege of making my own summer with my own coals  but what thinks lazarus can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights would not lazarus rather be in sumatra than here would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator yea ye gods go down to the fiery pit itself in order to keep out this frost  now that lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door of dixes this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the moluccas yet dixes himself he too lixes like a czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs and being a president of a temperance society he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans  but no more of this blubbering now we are going a whaling and there is plenty of that yet to come let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet and see what sort of a place this spouter may be   \n"
